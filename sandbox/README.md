## CSS

Utilize `css-modules` for seamless styling without the usual headache. No abstractive syntaxes are required. Just write your CSS the way you normally would (minus the specificity CSS usually requires) and your classes will be uniquely applied.

`PostCSS` runs our CSS through `autoprefixer` so our styles will work as cross-browser compatible as possible.

`Sass/SCSS` is supported, as well.
